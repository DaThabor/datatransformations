# Introduction {#intro}

My name is Thabor Walbeek, Data Scientist from profession, but working in all areas of data: from solution architect to BI professional. 
As one of the few non-technical background guys, I have had to learn my fair share before I was able to work with data in many different ways. 
Data as such is a broad concept and has many faces. I hope this book will help gathering all information I normally have to search for and spend many hours to do so. 
In this book you might (quickly) find a topic of your interest and I hope it will help you in getting things done much faster.

If you have any queries, please contact me at: thabor@dathabor.com
